      "=== Comparison ===\n",
      "Based on the given responses, the CRAG system performed better for this specific query. Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Accuracy and factual correctness: Both systems were unable to provide the exact year the politician began to represent Daventry. However, the CRAG system correctly identified the politician as Christopher Heaton-Harris, which is a factual piece of information that the Standard RAG system failed to provide.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Relevance to the query: The CRAG system's response was more relevant to the query as it identified the politician and provided some information about his career. The Standard RAG system's response was not relevant as it discussed artificial intelligence instead of the politician.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Completeness of the answer: Neither system provided a complete answer to the query. However, the CRAG system's response was more complete as it provided some information about the politician's career.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Clarity and organization: Both systems provided clear and well-organized responses. However, the CRAG system's response was more informative and relevant to the query.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Source attribution quality: The CRAG system provided multiple sources, including a link to the politician's Wikipedia page, which is a reliable source for this type of information. The Standard RAG system only mentioned a generic \"Document\" as its source, which is less informative and less reliable.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the CRAG system's ability to evaluate document relevance and switch to web search when needed proved to be more effective for this query. It provided a more accurate, relevant, and complete response with better source attribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Overall Analysis of CRAG vs Standard RAG ===\n",
      "1. When CRAG performs better and why:\n",
      "CRAG, or Corrective RAG, tends to perform better when the queries require a more nuanced understanding of the context or when the queries are complex. This is because CRAG uses a corrective mechanism that allows it to correct its own mistakes during the generation of responses. This mechanism is particularly useful when the system needs to handle ambiguous queries or when it needs to correct its own misunderstandings. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. When standard RAG performs better and why:\n",
      "Standard RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, performs better when the queries are straightforward and do not require a deep understanding of the context. This is because standard RAG uses a simpler mechanism that retrieves relevant documents and generates responses based on these documents. This mechanism is particularly effective when the system needs to provide factual information that can be directly retrieved from the documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The overall strengths and weaknesses of each approach:\n",
      "CRAG's main strength lies in its ability to correct its own mistakes, which makes it more robust and reliable in handling complex queries. However, this corrective mechanism can also be a weakness as it may lead to over-correction or unnecessary correction when the queries are straightforward. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, standard RAG's main strength lies in its simplicity and efficiency in retrieving relevant documents and generating responses. However, this simplicity can also be a weakness as it may lead to inaccuracies or misunderstandings when the queries require a deep understanding of the context.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Recommendations for when to use each approach:\n",
      "CRAG should be used when the queries are complex or ambiguous, or when the system needs to handle a wide range of queries with varying levels of complexity. \n",
      "\n",
      "Standard RAG should be used when the queries are straightforward and do not require a deep understanding of the context, or when the system needs to provide factual information quickly and efficiently.\n"
